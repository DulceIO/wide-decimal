# Wide-integer
Wide-integer implements a generic C++ template for extended precision unsigned integral types.

This C++ template header-only library implements drop-in big decimal float types such as `dec101_t`, `dec10001_t`, `dec1000001_t`, etc., that can be used essentially like regular built-in floating-point types. Wide-decimal supports decimal float types having digit counts ranging from about <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=30{\ldots}2,000,000">.
